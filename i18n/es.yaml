AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.academia: This skill covers your character’s education and accumulated knowledge, as well as their ability to research unfamiliar subjects. Academia is most useful when trying to study new information or recall facts about a subject.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.athletics: This skill covers your character’s physical conditioning, and athletic ability. Athletics also covers a character’s attempts to move with haste.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.engineering: "This skill encompasses your character’s technical and mechanical expertise, with an emphasis on practical applications: designing, building, and repairing devices, machines, and structures, as well as operating complex or untested equipment, and determining how to disable or destroy unfamiliar machines. There’s a degree of overlap between Engineering and Vehicles, but Engineering focuses on the mechanics of a vehicle."
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.fighting: This skill covers your character’s ability to fight and defend themselves against attacks, a combination of learned techniques, physical conditioning, and instinct. It is used to make attacks, judge threatening situations, and covers a practical understanding of weaponry and combat styles.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.medicine: This skill covers the treatment of physical and mental injuries, and the diagnosis and cure of poisons and diseases. It can also be used to perform autopsies to determine the cause of a person’s death.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.observation: This skill covers your character’s awareness and ability to discern information from their surroundings. It describes how observant and astute they are, how quickly they pick out important details and make use of them, as well as their ability to ignore distractions. Observation overlaps with many other skills, and often runs parallel to Academia, as both are about gaining information, albeit in different ways.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.persuasion: This skill encompasses your character’s ability to influence others, through a mixture of speech and body language. It also allows you to spot when others are attempting to use these techniques—it often takes a liar to spot a liar.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.resilience: This skill encompasses your character’s ability to resist and recover from physical and mental debilities — from injury, pain, and Fatigue and mental distress. This also includes withstanding the effects of poisons, diseases, and magical effects. You may use Resilience to try and resist effects before they happen, or to recover from lasting effects already succumbed to. While Medicine overlaps with Resilience in a few ways, Resilience is more concerned with an individual’s inherent toughness.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.stealth: This skill encompasses your character’s ability to pass undetected, from moving quietly, to using darkness, cover and concealment to remain unseen. It also covers your ability to use disguises, hide in plain sight, or use camouflage to conceal yourself and others.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.survival: This skill expresses your character’s ability to survive inhospitable conditions, including extremes of temperature and weather, dangerous plants and animals — as well as finding sufficient food and water, and creating a fire and a shelter. It also covers the ability to track animals (and enemies), as well as communicating with and training animals.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.tactics: This skill deals with your character’s ability to perceive and evaluate a combat situation and devise an appropriate plan. This not only covers military strategy and tactics, but also team dynamics and leadership, or organising a group of scientists or engineers.
AC2D20.Tooltips.Skill.vehicles: This skill covers the operation and maintenance of vehicles of all kinds. A character skilled in Vehicles is knowledgeable about how they function, what makes them fail, and how to maintain and repair them, as well as how to operate them. This overlaps with Engineering with regards to vehicles specifically, and a character driving a vehicle uses Vehicles instead of Athletics to avoid or overcome obstacles such as terrain features.
